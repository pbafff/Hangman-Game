# Hangman-Game

This is my version of the game of hangman, in which the player must guess a word - in this case the name of an obscure country - based on the number of blank spaces displayed on the middle of the screen. The [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/)  was used to generate a map which displays at load time the location of the Hudson Community College culinary arts building and/or the user's current location if they give the app location permission. As the player guesses names correctly the map updates to show the location of that country. There are currently 9 countries and the player gets 12 tries per name. A restart button will be added so that the player will not have to refresh the page to paly again when the game ends.
